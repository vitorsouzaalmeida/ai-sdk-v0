Sveltekit project.
It is a simple POC showing how to use V0 (model) with ai-sdk. I'm also streaming the v0 tools, so it's possible to call `v0.chats.createChat` or `v0.chats.sendMessage` letting you to create an 1:1 experience compared to the V0 API Platform (v0-sdk).

Since it is a POC, it is only creating a chat, no message history and things like that.
